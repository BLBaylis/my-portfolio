      The primary aim of this project was to fetch data from the Twitch.Tv API,
      in order to display a list of Twitch streams provided by Freecodecamp and
      display information about them including whether the stream was live.
    </p>
    <p className={styles.info}>
      I&#39;m a gamer who visits the Twitch website frequently and so I decided
      to go a bit further and flesh out the tool somewhat compared to the rather
      minimal aims of the project. As a result, I added search functionality for
      any streamer on Twitch along with some streams I personally enjoy and the
      featured streams of Twitch which display on the Twitch website main page.
    </p>
    <p className={styles.info}>
      This project was one of my earliest projects to deal with asynchronous
      Javscript and in particular ES6 Promises, which I learnt during this
      project. This led to working, but messy and hard to follow code.
    </p>
    <p className={styles.info}>
      I&#39;ve learnt much since then and my data fetching functions now utilise
      the fetch syntax and async/await syntax, which make for very
      straight-forward code. I gained a better grasp of the promise and
      generator functions which these features are built on.
    </p>
    <p className={styles.info}>
      This is my favourite project I&#39;ve worked on overall!
