    	<p className = {styles.info}>When I read about htis project on Freecodecamp, I had never heard of the concept of a 
    		pomodoro. The technique is used to increase your productivity and originally consisted of a 25 minute work session 
    		followed by a 5 minute break, which combined make up a single pomodoro. You would then as repeat this process until 
    		the work is done or your work session finishes. It is named after the italian word for tomato due to the inventor 
    		using a tomato timer to time himself.
    	</p>
    	<p className = {styles.info}>The biggest challenge of the project was probably trying to make a responsive circle. I felt
    		 the timer had to be circular, because circles and time are most associated with each other, for example clocks. I 
    		 also made a keyframes animation that syncs a line going around the screen with the timer like the hand of a clock. 
    		 Each stage of the pomodoro has a different color, which the background colour slowly changes to as time goes on. The 
    		 work phase is green for go and the break phase is red to stop. Check the animation out, I&#39;ve set the phases to 
    		 only be a minute each for demonstration purposes and I&#39;m pretty pleased with how it turned out!
    	</p>
    	<p className = {styles.info}>I had never worked with audio before this project, though the hard part was deciding on a 
    		alarm tone. I settled on chimes for a relaxed feel, not to mention the last thing I would want when I&#39;m concentrating 
    		deeply on my work is a loud buzzer to make me jump.
    	</p>
    	<p className = {styles.info}>Unfortunately, I hadn&#39;t learnt React.js when I made this as it would have been ideal. The 
    		idea of the different phases in a pomodoro is a textbook example of state. This, combined with the constant updating of 
    		the clock would have lent itself very well to React. Maybe one day, I&#39;ll come back and remake it, though this isn&#39;t 
    		a huge priority!
