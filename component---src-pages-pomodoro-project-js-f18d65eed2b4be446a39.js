The technique is used to increase your productivity and originally consisted of a 25 minute work session followed by a 5 minute break, which combined make up a single pomodoro. You would then repeat this process until the work is done or your work session finishes.

I felt the timer had to be circular, because circles and time are most associated with each other, for example clocks. I also made a keyframes animation that syncs a line going around the screen with the timer like the hand of a clock. Each stage of the pomodoro has a different colour, which the background colour slowly changes to as time goes on. The work phase is green for go and the break phase is red to stop. Check the animation out, I've set the phases to only be a minute each for demonstration purposes and I'm pretty pleased with how it turned out!"),i.default.createElement(d.default,{className:l.default.info,variant:"title"},"I had never worked with audio before this project, though the hard part was deciding on a alarm tone.
